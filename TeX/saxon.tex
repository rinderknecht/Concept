%% This TeX file expects

%%   (2) macro \saxlib to be the path to the Saxon library (a Java
%%       bytecode archive),
%%
%% Package `verbatim' is required.

%% Moreover, depending on the macro used, it may expect
%%   (3) macro \xmlURL to be a full URL (http://...) to a directory
%%       containing XML documents,
%%   (4) macro \xsltURL to be a full URL (http://...) to a directory
%%       containing XST stylesheets.
%%   (5) macro \XMLdir to be a file system path to the same

%%       directory as pointed by \xmlSLT.
